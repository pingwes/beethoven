A set of variations in Dâ™­ major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. (See image.) The four variations follow:

Similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.
An embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.
A rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.
A reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.
The fourth variation ends with a deceptive cadence containing the dominant chord that resolves to a soft diminished seventh, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition (without pause) to the finale.
