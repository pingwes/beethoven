The finale, also in sonata form, starts joyfully on a B♭ dominant 7th chord, in 68 time. After the startling introduction, the first subject shows up in the right hand and is immediately transferred to the left hand, which is repeated twice with an elaboration of the arrangement in the right hand. Before the second subject group arrives, there is one remarkable bridge passage, introducing a phrase that goes from G♭ major to F major chords, first through distinctive forte arpeggios, then in a more delicate, fine piano arrangement.
