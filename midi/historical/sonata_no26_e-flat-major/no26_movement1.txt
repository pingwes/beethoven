The sonata opens in a 2
4 time Adagio with a short, simple motif of three chords, at first forming an interrupted cadence, over which are written the three syllables Le-be-wohl ("Fare-thee-well"). This motif is the basis upon which both the first and the second subject groups are drawn. As soon as the introduction is over and the exposition begins, the time signature changes to cut time (alla breve) and the score is marked Allegro.

The first movement oscillates between a turbulent first subject which portrays deep disturbance and a second subject which is more lyrical in nature and gives the impression of reflections. The rhythmic figure of two short notes and a longer note which is used repeatedly in the first subject is developed inexorably through the "development" section with rich harmonies and discords which are harmonically closer to the later period of Beethoven's compositions than the middle for their intellectual penetration.

The movement has a surprisingly long coda which occupies over a quarter of the movement's length. The coda encompasses both the subjects in a display of powerful mastery over composition.
