The Andante espressivo is harmonically built on variations of the diminished chord and the appoggiatura. The movement is very emotional and is often played with rubato that would be found in later composers such as Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms. Much of the subject matter is rhythmically repeated consecutively as well as sectionally, perhaps to emphasise the feelings of uncomfortable solitude and fear of no return. The arrival of the dominant seventh chord at the end of movement signals the return to the tonic key, but remains unresolved until the triumphant appearance of the main theme in the final movement (which begins attacca). Typically the movement lasts just under 4 minutes.
