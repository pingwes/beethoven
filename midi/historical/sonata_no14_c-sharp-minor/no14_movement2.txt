The second movement is a relatively conventional scherzo in triple time, with the first section of the scherzo not repeated. It is a seeming moment of relative calm written in D♭ major, the more easily notated enharmonic equivalent of C♯ major, the parallel major of the first movement's key, C♯ minor. Franz Liszt is said to have described the second movement as "a flower between two chasms".[23] The slight majority of the movement is in piano (p), but a handful of sforzandos (sfz) and fortepianos (fp) helps to maintain the movement's cheerful disposition. This movement is described by many[who?] as the least popular movement, as most people recognize the first movement and the third movement more.
