The fourth movement is in a rondo form: A–B–A–C–A–B–A–Coda.[2] The first "A" theme starts in the tonic key, and the "B" theme transitions into the dominant key with big grand arpeggios in the right hand using a good portion of the keyboard. After the arpeggios, both hands play around with the "A" theme's melody before arriving back to the tonic key at the second "A" theme (with very little deviation from the first "A" theme). Suddenly, the "C" theme begins with a key change into B♭ minor (although not marked in the key signature). The sharp forte chords, although in stark contrast with the rest of the rondo, bear some resemblance to the first few chords of the "B" theme. The right hand then plays urgent thirty-second notes while the left hand supports with staccato sixteenth notes. This reaches a climax, a call-and-response play on the beginning of the "C" theme, and the thirty-second-note passage with the climax again.
