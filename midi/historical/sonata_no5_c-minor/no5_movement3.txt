The third movement is in sonata form, making heavy use of a figure of five eighth notes. The short development section contains an unmistakable foreshadow of the theme from Beethoven's Symphony No. 5. The coda slows the tempo down, leading to a final outburst which fades to a quiet Picardy third on a leading-tone IAC, giving a sense of relief.
