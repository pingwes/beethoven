The second movement is a lyrical Adagio with many embellishments. It is in "sonatina" form (there is no development section, only a single bar of a rolled V7 chord (Eâ™­7) leading back to the tonic key); an apparent third appearance of the main theme turns into a coda, which slowly fades to a final perfect cadence.
