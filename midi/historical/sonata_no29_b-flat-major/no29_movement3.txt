The ternary-form slow movement, centred on Fâ™¯ minor, has been called, among other things, a "mausoleum of collective sorrow",[5] and is notable for its ethereality and great length as a slow movement (e.g. Wilhelm Kempff played for approximately 16 minutes and Christoph Eschenbach 25 minutes) that finally ends with a Picardy third. Paul Bekker called the movement "the apotheosis of pain, of that deep sorrow for which there is no remedy, and which finds expression not in passionate outpourings, but in the immeasurable stillness of utter woe".[6] Wilhelm Kempff described it as "the most magnificent monologue Beethoven ever wrote"
