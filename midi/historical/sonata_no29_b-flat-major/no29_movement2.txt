The brief second movement includes a great variety of harmonic and thematic material. The scherzo's theme – which Rosen calls a humorous form[4] of the first movement's first subject – is at once playful, lively, and pleasant. The scherzo, in B♭ major, maintains the standard ternary form by repeating the sections an octave higher in the treble clef.

The trio, marked "semplice", is in the parallel minor, B♭ minor, but the effect is more shadowy than dramatic. It borrows the opening theme from the composer's Eroica symphony and places it in a minor key. Following this dark interlude, Beethoven inserts a more intense presto section in 2
4 meter, still in the minor, which eventually segues back to the scherzo. After a varied reprise of the scherzo's first section, a coda with a meter change to cut time follows. This coda plays with the semitonal relationship between B♭ and B♮, and briefly returns to the first theme before dying away.
