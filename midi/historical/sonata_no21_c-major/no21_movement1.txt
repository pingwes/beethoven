The first movement is in sonata form: it has a repeated exposition with two subject groups, a development section, a recapitulation and a coda.[1] t then swiftly ascends, followed by a three-note descent in the middle register and a four-note descent in the upper. This phrase is then repeated starting on B♭ major – a whole tone lower – a device Beethoven also used for the opening of the Sonata No. 16 in G Major (Op. 31 No. 1). After a half cadence to the dominant (G major), the opening phrase returns again but this time in a tremolo variation.[2] The second subject group, marked dolce, is a chordal theme in E major, the mediant key. Modulation to the mediant for the second subject area is another feature shared by this sonata and the Sonata No. 16.[2] Beethoven would employ the same shift again in later works (in the Hammerklavier Sonata, for example).
